## Overview

Hurl is a command-line tool inspired by HTTPie, Postman, and curl, designed for developers who prefer to manage and execute HTTP requests from the terminal. Born out of a love for Neovim and the streamlined efficiency of terminal-based workflows, Hurl is crafted for those who thrive in the command-line environment. Unlike traditional tools that require manual input for each request, Hurl allows users to store their HTTP requests in files and execute them directly from the command line. Whether you're editing code, managing version control, or interacting with web services, Hurl is intended to keep you in the zone, without ever leaving the comforting embrace of the terminal.

## Features

- **Save and Reuse Requests**: Store your HTTP requests in simple text files for easy reuse and version control.
- **Support for Multiple HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
- **Headers & Payload Handling**: Easily add headers and payloads to your requests.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables in your request files for different deployment stages (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Response Highlighting**: Color-coded response output for easy reading and debugging.
- **File Uploads**: (TODO) Support for multipart file uploads. 
- **History & Repeat**: Keep a history of your requests and repeat them with a single command.

## Installation
TODO

## Usage

1. **Creating a Request File**: Create a new file (e.g., `request.txt`) and write your HTTP request following the format:

    ```
    GET https://example.com/api/resource
    Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
    ```

2. **Executing a Request**: Use the `hurl` command followed by the path to your request file:

    ```bash
    hurl request.txt
    ```

3. **Using Variables**: To use environment variables in your requests, define them in your files like this:

    ```
    GET https://example.com/api/resource
    Authorization: Bearer {{API_TOKEN}}
    ```

    And execute your request like this:

    ```bash
    API_TOKEN=your_token_here hurl request.txt
    ```

4. **Viewing Response**: The response will be printed directly to your terminal, with syntax highlighting for JSON responses.

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```

For large responses, you can also output response bodies to files using `-o` flag
```bash
hurl -o=./response.json examples/post.txt
```
## Configuration
You can configure hurl by creating a `hurl.json` file in your current working directory. Available configurations include setting `.env` file path, default headers (TODO), response timeout (TODO). Below is an example config.
```yaml
{
    // path to your .env file
    "env": "/path/to/.env/file"
}
```

## Flags
all flags need to come before the path to the request file.
* `-o=/path/to/file.json`: path to a file to output response body content
* `-v`: verbose out, prints all request and response headers in a format similar to a raw HTTP request and response
